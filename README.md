## Current Project: MyCity
[![MyCity]](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2024/MyCity)
**MyCity** is designed to revolutionize the way municipalities, communities, and third-party vendors manage, repair, and track assets. Acting as a single point of contact, MyCity allows users to log tickets related to these assets and receive updates while the ticket is in progress.

### Key Features:
- **Wide Range of Assets:** Handle multiple types of assets across different municipalities.
- **User-Friendly Ticketing:** Log tickets for issues like potholes or faulty transformers via desktop or mobile devices.
- **Robust Tracking Mechanism:** Manage communication between users and organizations efficiently.
- **GPS-Enabled Mapping:** Easily locate assets and navigate to them.
- **Guest Access:** Allow non-registered users to report issues quickly.
- **Community Engagement:** Verify and prioritize issues through up-voting and down-voting.
- **Photo Uploads:** Option to upload photos of issues for better verification.

### My Role:
DevOps, UI Engineer, and Designer, I am involved in:
- Co-designing and prototyping user-oriented interfaces using Figma.
- Developing the frontend with technologies like React, Next.js, and ensuring seamless integration.
- Overseeing DevOps practices to ensure smooth deployment and maintenance.
- Implementing and managing network infrastructures to support robust application performance.

## Major Past Project: Reddit Clone
[![Reddit Clone]](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2024/MiniProject8)
This project involved building a simplified, functional Reddit clone in a 10-week software engineering mini-project with a team of 11. We followed a structured development process divided into two 5-week sprints. The core objective was to replicate the core functionalities of Reddit, including user authentication, authorisation, and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for posts and comments. We focused on delivering a seamless user experience while ensuring data integrity and system scalability.

### My Contributions:
As part of this project, I played a multifaced role. I was a:
- **UI engineer:** I was one of the UI enginner's who implemented the user interface (UI) design using React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to clone the Reddit platform closely, ensuring intuitive navigation and user-friendly interactions.
- **Architect:**  I also co-developed the overall system architecture, defining the structure and behaviour of the application while prioritising security, reliability, and performance.
- **Database Engineer:** I played a key role in creating comprehensive mock data to simulate real-world scenarios and populate the database, ensuring data integrity.
- **Project Manager:** I served as co-project manager, assisting in planning, coordinating, and executing project tasks and milestones. I managed administrative tasks such as scheduling meetings, tracking progress, and resolving any project-related issues.

## Technical Skills
- **Languages:** C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP
- **Frameworks and Tools:** React, Next.js, Node.js, MySQL, AWS, Adobe Creative Cloud, Figma
- **DevOps and Networking:** Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, Linux, Networking protocols
